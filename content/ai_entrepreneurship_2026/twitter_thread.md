## Thread 1: One-Person Unicorn

**Tweet 1/10** 🧵
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicts: "The first one-person unicorn will emerge in 2026."

One person. $1 billion company.

After 200+ research queries, I believe him. Here's why 👇

**Tweet 2/10**
The Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey revealed something shocking:

Only 1% of developers write code entirely by hand.

57.74% say most of their code is AI-generated.

Andrej Karpathy calls it "Vibe Coding" – the hottest programming language is now English.

**Tweet 3/10**
The tools have arrived:

• Cursor: $9.9B valuation, AI-native IDE
• Claude Code: 1M context, deep reasoning
• Lovable.dev: Build MVPs through conversation
• Replit Agent: One-click deployment

A non-programmer can now ship a product in 3 weeks.

**Tweet 4/10**
The infrastructure is ready:

• Vercel: Free tier handles 100K visits
• Supabase: Free PostgreSQL + Auth
• Stripe: Pay only when you earn
• Cloudflare: Free CDN

Total cost to launch: $0

**Tweet 5/10**
The market is unified:

Anthropic's MCP (Model Context Protocol) is now adopted by:
• OpenAI
• Google
• AWS

This is the HTTP moment for AI. Interoperability unlocks exponential value.

**Tweet 6/10**
The Agentic AI market:

2025: $7.55B
2026: $10.86B (+44%)
2030: $52.62B

AI agents that actually DO things, not just chat.

This is where the next generation of products will be built.

**Tweet 7/10**
My 4-week MVP framework:

Week 1: Validate (100 user interviews)
Week 2: Build (Cursor + Supabase + Vercel)
Week 3: Test (10 seed users)
Week 4: Launch (first 10 paying customers)

If you can't get 10 paying users in 4 weeks, pivot.

**Tweet 8/10**
Three verticals I'm bullish on:

1. AI Video Factory ($85B market)
2. AI Customer Service Agents (65% cost reduction)
3. AI Education (4.3B Gen Z in China alone)

All have clear monetization paths.

**Tweet 9/10**
The only moat: Data Flywheel

Product → Users → Data → Better Model → Better Product → More Users

Start collecting valuable user behavior data from Day 1.

This is how you build defensibility in the AI era.

**Tweet 10/10**
2026 will be the year of the "Super Individual."

One person with:
• AI = 100-person team productivity
• Cloud = Enterprise infrastructure
• Internet = 8 billion potential customers

The question isn't whether it's possible.

The question is: Are you ready?

## Thread 2: China AI Compliance

**Tweet 1/7** 🧵
Building AI products for China?

September 1, 2025 is a critical date.

Here's what every founder needs to know about China's AI regulations 👇

**Tweet 2/7**
The Generative AI Content Labeling Rule takes effect Sept 1, 2025:

✅ All AI-generated content must be labeled
✅ Deepfakes require explicit consent
✅ AI voice cloning needs authorization

Violations: ¥50,000 - ¥500,000 fines

**Tweet 3/7**
Platform-specific rules:

WeChat:
• AI content must be disclosed
• Use domestic LLM APIs
• No reverse engineering

Xiaohongshu:
• Mandatory AI labels
• CES algorithm: Comments 4x, Shares 4x, Follows 8x

**Tweet 4/7**
High-risk activities to avoid:

❌ Unregistered overseas APIs
❌ Unauthorized face-swapping
❌ Fake news generation
❌ Bypassing content moderation

These can result in criminal liability, not just fines.

**Tweet 5/7**
Compliance checklist:

□ Algorithm registration (if serving China)
□ AI content labeling system
□ Updated user agreements
□ Data localization for sensitive info

**Tweet 6/7**
Safe alternatives:

• DeepSeek: Compliant, competitive with GPT-4
• Qwen: Alibaba's model, strong Chinese
• MiniMax: Great for voice/video
• Zhipu: GLM series, good for reasoning

All have proper Chinese licenses.

**Tweet 7/7**
Bottom line:

China's AI market is massive (Gen Z alone: $450B+ spending power).

But compliance isn't optional.

Build it right from Day 1, or face expensive pivots later.

## Thread 3: Tools Comparison

**Tweet 1/6** 🧵
Claude Code vs Cursor vs GitHub Copilot

After using all three extensively, here's my honest comparison 👇

**Tweet 2/6**
Claude Code (Anthropic):

Pros:
• Best reasoning ability
• 1M context window
• Native terminal integration
• Understands entire codebases

Cons:
• CLI only (no GUI)
• Requires Anthropic subscription

Best for: Complex refactoring, architecture decisions

**Tweet 3/6**
Cursor (AI-native IDE):

Pros:
• Beautiful VS Code fork
• Tab completion is magic
• Composer for multi-file edits
• $9.9B valuation = well-funded

Cons:
• Can be slow on large projects
• $20/month for Pro

Best for: Daily coding, rapid prototyping

**Tweet 4/6**
GitHub Copilot (Microsoft):

Pros:
• Best GitHub integration
• Works in any IDE
• Enterprise-grade security
• Copilot Workspace

Cons:
• Less context-aware
• Suggestions can be generic

Best for: Teams already on GitHub

**Tweet 5/6**
My stack:

• Claude Code for planning & complex tasks
• Cursor for daily development
• Copilot as backup in VS Code

Cost: ~$50/month total

ROI: 10x productivity. Worth every cent.

**Tweet 6/6**
The meta-insight:

The tool matters less than how you use it.

The best developers in 2026 aren't the fastest coders.

They're the best prompt engineers.

Learn to communicate with AI, and any tool becomes powerful.
