## Tweet 1 (Hook)

🧵 **51 seconds.**

That's how fast the most sophisticated attackers now move from initial access to lateral movement.

Down from 62 MINUTES just last year.

Here's what changed in AI cybersecurity in 2025 (and what you need to know) 👇

## Tweet 2 (The Numbers)

📊 The numbers are alarming:

• Vishing attacks: +442%
• Deepfake fraud: +1,600% (Q1 alone)
• Malware-free attacks: 79%
• China-linked APT groups: +150%

Traditional security is already obsolete.

## Tweet 3 (Agentic AI Risk)

🤖 The rise of Agentic AI changes everything.

Old threat: Prompt → Bad output → Info leak

NEW threat: Prompt → Decision manipulated → Action executed → System compromised

When AI agents can execute code autonomously, prompt injection = RCE.

## Tweet 4 (Real Case)

💰 The $25M Hong Kong case proved it:

A finance worker was tricked by deepfake video calls impersonating the CFO.

Real-time deepfake detection isn't optional anymore—it's survival.

## Tweet 5 (Market Response)

📈 The market is responding:

AI cybersecurity market:
• 2024: $22.4B
• 2030: $134B (projected)
• CAGR: 24.4%

But money alone won't solve this. Architecture must change.

## Tweet 6 (Priority 1)

✅ Priority #1: Audit AI Agent Permissions

Most orgs don't know what their AI tools can access.

Ask yourself:
• What tools can each AI agent use?
• What actions can they execute?
• What data can they exfiltrate?

## Tweet 7 (Priority 2-3)

✅ Priority #2: Deploy Deepfake Detection
• Video conference verification
• Voice authentication
• Multi-factor for high-value decisions

✅ Priority #3: EU AI Act Compliance
• August 2025: GPAI provisions active
• Penalties: Up to €35M or 7% global revenue
