🧵 Here's what you need to know about the AI productivity revolution:

The paradigm shift is real. 📊

Traditional workflow: Open Finder → Browse files → Open apps → Manually execute
Time cost: 10-15 minutes

Raycast AI workflow: Type intent → AI executes autonomously
Time cost: 30 seconds ⚡

That's not just faster—it's a fundamentally different operating model.

Let's talk privacy. ✅

Unlike tools that centralize everything in the cloud, Raycast:
• Stores clipboard history locally (encrypted)
• Zero-knowledge cloud sync
• SOC 2 Type II certified
• No training data collection from any LLM provider

Privacy + power. Not a tradeoff—a requirement.
